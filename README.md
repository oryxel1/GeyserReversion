# GeyserReversion
- Inspired by https://github.com/bundabrg/GeyserReversion, entirely different codebase tho uhhh
- The "library" used for translating stuff is here https://github.com/oryxel1/To-ViaBedrock
- Currently, support: 1.21.93 -> 1.21.40 (that it lol.)
- This will flag anticheats and stuff, it that ain't obvious enough already.
