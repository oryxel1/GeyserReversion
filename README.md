# GeyserReversion
- Inspired by https://github.com/bundabrg/GeyserReversion, entirely different codebase tho uhhh
- The "library" used for translating stuff is a fork of [Ouranos](https://github.com/Blackjack200/Ouranos) aka https://github.com/oryxel1/Ouranos 
- Currently, support: 1.21.93 -> 1.12.0 (yeh)
- This will flag anticheats and stuff, it that ain't obvious enough already.
